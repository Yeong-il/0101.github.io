        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Yeong-il Kim. 
            I majored in astronomy and double majored in physics at Chungnam National University. 
            While attending school, I had experience in observation, simulation, data analysis, and visualization of the universe. 
            I'm currently interested in satellite and SW development and aims to be responsible for such work in the future. 
            I mainly have experience writing code in Python.

            <h3>Cubesat 2017 DEM (Digital Elevation Model)</h3>
            <p>
                A CubeSat, or Cube Satellite, is a type of miniaturized satellite for space research that usually has a standard size and form factor. 
                The CubeSat design originated at Stanford University in 1999, and it has since become a popular standard for small satellite development. 
                The term "Cube" in CubeSat refers to the cube shape, and "Sat" stands for satellite.
                The standard CubeSat sizes are defined in terms of "units," where each unit (U) is a cube with dimensions of 10x10x10 centimeters. <br><br>
                A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a digital representation of the Earth's surface topography.
                Our CubeSat can be expected to be used in hidden alpine terrain or polar regions for filming with drones.
                In charge of the structure part, I was responsible for visualizing the satellite and mission.

            <p>
                An exoplanet is a planet located outside our solar system, orbiting a star other than the Sun. 
                The first confirmed detection of an exoplanet occurred in 1992, and since then, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered using various methods and technologies.
                Transits are a method of detecting exoplanets. This involves detecting slight, periodic dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it from our line of sight.
                The habitable zone, also known as the Goldilocks zone, is the region around a star where conditions may be suitable for liquid water to exist on the surface of an orbiting planet.<br><br>
                Through observations with the Goheung 1-m telescope, I analyzed the transit phenomenon of exoplanets and whether they were habitable.

            <h3>CNN (Convolution Neural Network) 기법을 이용해 구름 사진 분류</h3>
            <p>
                A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks that is particularly well-suited for image recognition and processing. 
                CNNs have proven highly effective in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition, but they are also used in various other domains, including natural language processing and speech recognition.<br><br>
                We designed the project with the goal of receiving cloud photos and classifying what type of cloud it is using the CNN technique.
                It was suggested that identifying what kind of cloud it is means that users, rather than satellites, can judge local weather forecasts in real time, thereby predicting precipitation and weather.

                The IllustrisTNG simulation is a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation that models the evolution of the universe, including the formation and evolution of galaxies.<br><br>
                Research on the characteristics of galaxy clusters in which star formation is taking place and galaxy clusters in a quenched state in the current galaxy in the universe is necessary to study the coevolution of galaxy clusters and the medium within them.
                Investigating whether the blue cluster accommodates the hot intracluster medium (ICM) and constrains its evolutionary stages suggests a link between galaxy morphology and evolution. In order to conduct such research, an extensive investigation into the Blue Cluster is necessary.
                Simulation data were analyzed using statistical techniques and fitting.

            <p>
                Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it undetectable by electromagnetic radiation. 
                Its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters.
                Dark matter is believed to constitute approximately 27% of the total mass and energy content of the universe.<br><br>
                Primordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang.
                In this study, we studied the creation and extinction of primordial black holes along with the history from the early universe.

            <p>
                General Relativity (GR) is a fundamental theory of gravitation formulated by Albert Einstein in 1915. It describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. 
                General relativity is a key component of modern physics and has been incredibly successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena, from the behavior of planets and galaxies to the bending of light around massive objects.<br><br>
                The planets of the solar system are approximated using the Schwarzschild metric to calculate the precessional motion, evidence of general relativity.
